# hello-world

I'm Mike Randle, a PHD student in electrical engineering. I'm currently taking a computational physics course and that is why I am now a member of GitHub.

In my experience, the only difference between a researcher in an engineering lab and an experimental physicist is the interactions with your funding agency. 

Engineers: Uhhhh, sure MICRON... we'll have a competitive transistor made out of CDW materials that nobody has studied before by next year!

Physicists: Uhhhh, sure NSF... we'll have a competitive transistor made out of CDW materials that nobody has studied before by next year!

Both: Please issue the grant check before the 1st of the month so I can pay my rent!!!


Cheers! Preferably with Canadian beer.
